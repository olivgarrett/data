I downloaded the Texas Tribune's faces-of-death-row repository. The repository contains the code for an interactive visualization that allows readers to search through death row inmates. The code is primarily JavaScript. They built asystem of searchable filters, including time on death row, county, race, age and sex. The data is displayed as mugshots. When you hover over the images, you can click for more information on the person and their crime. I think the practical applications of this app are very interesting-- you could use it to build a similar vizualization on all sorts of data sets. The repository contains so many JavaScript and style files. How do you keep track of all the seperate files and pieces of code that you need to build something like this?
